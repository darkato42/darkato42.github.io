我选了这条路线比较适合我们进入National Park的大致方向。从停车场出发然后沿着Pyg Track徒步到达Summit后沿着Miners' Track返回停车场。全程一共是13km, 预计步行时间大概是6小时。

<strong>Start</strong>: Pen-y-Pass Car Park, postcode LL55 4NY. <br>
This is the most expensive car park at £10 per day, and the busiest.  Arrive first thing in the morning to get a place. If Pen y Pass car park is full, you can park in Nant Peris (SH 607582 / LL55 4UF) and catch the Sherpa bus back up to Pen y Pass. (大伙怎么看?)

<strong>Finish</strong>: A circular route ends at the same car park.

6km - good route

The Pyg and the Miners Tracks start at the same point.  The car park here gets very full, and an early start is essential.  It is not known how the Pyg Track got its name - it could be as it passes over the Pigs's Pass (Bwlch y Mocl), because it is close to the Pen y Gwryd Hotel, or because pyg, in welsh, also means pitch, and part of the surface of the path looks like black pitch.  Whatever the origin, this path starts 1,170 feet above sea level which gives you a helpful start on the way.  

Much of this walk is rugged, and very challenging, but the scenery is interesting.  You can read a description of the walk up the Miners Track and back down the Pyg Track here.

7km - easy first part

This is a good walk to try if you want to walk on Snowdon but don't want to try to reach the summit as the first part is fairly gentle.  The track was built during the 1800's to serve Britannia Copper Mines which were abandoned in 1917.  Mine Manager Arthur Lockwood drove his car to Llyn Glaslyn, and the track to this point at the lake still resembles a road so is a good walking surface.  The track does get considerably steeper towards the summit.
