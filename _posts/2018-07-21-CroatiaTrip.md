### Accommodation

The bracket after each date states where to stay for the night. See some of the booking recommendations below.

#### Dubrovnik

One great place to stay – far away from the old town madness but easily reachable by bus/car – is the **Lapad** peninsula. Despite being an area with many high-end luxurious hotels, it’s also possible to find cheap accommodation next to the best beaches near Dubrovnik. Take a look at [this shortlist in Booking](https://www.geekyexplorer.com/suggests/hotels-dubrovnik/). It contains only the top-rated hotels in Dubrovnik, with WiFi and breakfast included.

### My schedules

I'm visiting Dolomites in Italy before flying to Dubrovnik from Venice.
