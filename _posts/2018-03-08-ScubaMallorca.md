### Summary

Time: 3+ Days from 8:00am, Monday, 30th April 2018

Location: [Scuba Mallorca](http://scubamallorca.com/), Carrer d’Elcano 23, 07470 Port de Pollença, Mallorca, Spain ([View in Google Map](https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=39.909149,3.007624&z=11&t=m&hl=en-US&gl=US&mapclient=embed&cid=11490185346530403221))

Price: £118 PADI eLearning + €295(in cash for greater discount) actual course in Mallorca

### Course Structure

* [PADI theory eLearning](https://apps.padi.com/scuba-diving/elearning/purchasecourse.aspx): This is a prerequisite we need to finish before starting the on-site diving course. The online learning option costs £118 when choosing 'England, Great Britain' as the country.

* Day1: Full day around 6 hours. Briefing, equipments and confined water (pool) sections. 
* Day2-3: Half day, starting from 8:30 until 12:30.
* Day4(optional): If we haven't passed in the end of day 3, there will be optional days to sharpen our skills.
* More days: We get discounted price, 40 euros per 2 dives, if we want to dive on our own.

### Accommodation

I think it's better to stay within driving distance of the diving centre. Hotel or AirBnb apartments I'm indifferent with. The price looks like mostly £50 per person per night for a twin room. 

### Other activities

There are biking trails, walking routes or sea kayaking places around the north of Mallorca. I've booked an estate car (5 seats) for us to explore the area easily.

I'll try to ask the diving centre if they have GoPro we can borrow. If any of you have one, please bring it along.
